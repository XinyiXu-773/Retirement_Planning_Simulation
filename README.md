## Retirement Planning Simulation

This project is an Excel-based retirement planning model designed to project long-term financial outcomes under different assumptions, including salary growth, KiwiSaver contributions, investment returns, and inflation.

### What the model includes
- Structured Excel model with clearly defined input assumptions
- Long-term cash flow and balance projections
- Scenario and sensitivity analysis
- Summary tables and charts to support interpretation
- Outputs designed to support comparison and decision-making across scenarios

### Purpose
The project focuses on building and maintaining a clear, structured spreadsheet model that supports financial decision-making under uncertainty. Emphasis was placed on data consistency, transparency of assumptions, and interpretable outputs, rather than complex automation.

*This project was completed for academic purposes using a simulated client scenario.*

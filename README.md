## Retirement Planning Simulation

This project is an Excel-based retirement planning model that projects long-term financial outcomes under various assumptions, including salary growth, KiwiSaver contribution rates, investment returns, and inflation. It is designed to support comparison across scenarios and help evaluate the impact of different contributions and investment choices over time.

### What the model includes
- Structured Excel model with clearly defined input assumptions
- Long-term cash flow and balance projections
- Scenario and sensitivity analysis
- Summary tables and charts to support interpretation

### Purpose
The project focuses on building and maintaining a clear, structured spreadsheet model that supports financial decision-making under uncertainty. Emphasis was placed on data consistency, transparency of assumptions, and interpretable outputs, rather than complex automation.

*This project was created for academic purposes, using a simulated client scenario.*
